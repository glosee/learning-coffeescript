# Learning Coffeescript

This is a sandbox for learning how to be productive with coffeescript. It will contain a lot of examples from different tutorials or books, which will be called out in each individual file.

To start off, I am working through [Smashing CoffeeScript](http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118454375.html). As times goes on I may work on other ideas in this repo.

## About Gulp setup

I wanted to automate cofeescript compilation while working through this, and I wanted to try out Gulp. How better to achieve both these things than to Google "setting up gulp and coffeescript". I stumbled upon [this article](http://vincent.is/introducing-people-to-gulp/), which taught me that your gulpfile can be written in coffeescript too! I mostly copied but also modified the script from the aforementioned article, so thank you to @Keats for the awesome tutorial.
