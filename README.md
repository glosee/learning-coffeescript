# Learning Coffeescript

This is a sandbox for learning how to be productive with coffeescript. It will contain a lot of examples from different tutorials or books, which will be called out in each individual file.

To start off, I am working through [Smashing CoffeeScript](http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118454375.html). As times goes on I may work on other ideas in this repo.
